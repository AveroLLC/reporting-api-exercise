# Backend Coding Exercise
The following is intended as a coding exercise for backend developers.

## Avero Reporting API

Your task is to build a reporting API on top of point of sale data extracted from Avero customer restaurants. You will retreive the source data from our existing POS APIs, and implement a reporting API to calculate and deliver a number of common metrics.

## Business Requirements:
- Deliver an http-based reporting api that implements a single `/reporting` endpoint
    - A consumer should be able to provide a date range, a bucketing time interval, a business id, and a report type (defined below).
    - The api should return a report, calculated from the source POS data.
- The reporting API should not spam the source api for each request.
    - POS data should be extracted from the source API and stored separately - this could be in a reporting database, flat files, or in an in-memory data structure.
- You DO NOT need to account for synchronizing with the source api over time.
    - There are a fixed number of businesses with a fixed number of menu items, employees, labor entries, checks and ordered items; they will not change.

## Expectations:
- You may use any language, library, database, and framework that you wish. Ultimately, you should choose whatever tools will best enable you to deliver a quality product.
- The API endpoints that we have provided should be all that you need.
- There may some ambiguity in the business requirements. You are free to make assumptions where you feel like the requirements are unclear. If you do, please document these assumptions in the README.
- This exercise should take about 4-8 hours to complete. It should represent your best effort - but we understand that it is a side project. We do not expect perfection. =)
- There is no one approach we are looking for, however you should be prepared to discuss the decisions and design choices made.

## Delivery
- Your final output should be a link to a publicly hosted repo (e.g. GitHub, bitbucket) which includes all of your code, assets, etc. Anything that we need to run your project and wish us to evaluate.
- Your code should include a README file with clear instructions for running your solution. Any dependencies, build commands, etc - every step after `git clone …` should be clearly documented. If we can’t run it, we can’t evaluate it!
- If you wish to include any other resources (design docs, planning breakdown, etc), you may reference and link them from the README.
- When you're ready for us to review, you should email whoever you have been in contact with at Avero.

## You will be evaluated on (in roughly this order)
- Our ability to access and run your code. If we can’t run it, we can’t evaluate it.
- Your adherence to the business and technical requirements outlined above. Beautiful code doesn’t matter if it doesn’t work correctly!
- The quality of your code. Think about good engineering practices - legibility, maintainability, separation of concerns, usability. This should be code that you are proud of.

## API Bugs
If you are reading this then you are one of the first people to do this code exercise and there are probably bugs in the API!

If you come across a bug, please help us out and [file an issue](https://github.com/AveroLLC/reporting-api-exercise/issues), or contact your recruiter directly.


## Source Point of Sale System API

A restaurant Point of Sale (POS) is a system for managing the transactions within a restaurant. If you have ever seen a server enter your table’s order into a touch screen and then run your credit card through it at the end of the meal, they were interacting with the POS.  Many POS systems expose an API for 3rd party integration.
For this exercise you will be retrieving sales and labor data for a set hypothetical restaurants from an API provided by the fictional Avero Point of Sale System.

---

## POS Entities

These are the data models that you will retrieve from the source POS API, and back the reporting domain.

### Businesses 
A business represents a restaurant.
```json
{
     "id":"b2aeb27b-c85c-4ad8-83d4-d9511063d418",
     "name":"Red BBQ",
     "hours":[11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22],
     "updated_at":"2018-07-27T16:34:12.910Z",
     "created_at":"2018-07-27T16:34:12.910Z"
}
```

### Check
A check represents a set of ordered items, and the associatedn individual payment.
```json
{
     "id":"f749b9ff-601b-4992-8b51-fc918310ee35",
     "business_id":"b2aeb27b-c85c-4ad8-83d4-d9511063d418",
     "employee_id":"b63d9159-b2f9-4fd0-bb53-5dfeaee89e85",
     "name":"Andy Bolden",
     "closed":true,
     "closed_at":"2018-04-01T17:35:00.000Z",
     "updated_at":"2018-07-31T00:56:16.972Z",
     "created_at":"2018-04-01T17:03:00.000Z"
}
```

#### Ordered Item
A menu item that has been added to a check.
- Ordered items contains data such as the `(employee_id, check_id, business_id, menu_id)` so that we can reference back to the corresponding entities that relates to the ordered item.
- `cost` is the amount of money that it cost the business to prepare the item.
- `price` is the amount of money that is charged to the customer.
- Ordered items can be `voided`. If and ordered item is voided the value of `price` of this item is not computed into the total of the check.

You can think of an ordered item as a snapshot in time of a menu item added to a check - even if the cost or price changes at some point in the future, this will not affect ordered items in the past.
Ordered items are used to calculate metrics for sales and cost reports.

```json
{
    "id": "cb889c5c-c969-4ac1-a25b-70cd28c83f76",
    "business_id": "b2aeb27b-c85c-4ad8-83d4-d9511063d418",
    "employee_id": "b63d9159-b2f9-4fd0-bb53-5dfeaee89e85",
    "check_id": "5b99a5eb-d426-4867-990a-80ebe1e0617f",
    "item_id": "d1b1299c-54dc-4163-8ee1-04488f50c071",
    "name": "Reds Brisket",
    "cost": 10,
    "price": 17,
    "voided": false,
    "updated_at": "2018-05-02T20:30:00.000Z",
    "created_at": "2018-07-31T21:14:41.413Z"
} 
```  

### Menu Items
An individual food or beverage that will appear on a check as an ordered item.
- `cost` is the current amount that it will cost the business to make prepare the a menu item.
- `price` is the current amount that will be charged to the customer.
```json
{
     "id":"a7c9f9f0-4936-4a4a-88d7-f9f76ebce1bd",
     "business_id":"b2aeb27b-c85c-4ad8-83d4-d9511063d418",
     "name":"Smokin Ribs",
     "cost":12,
     "price":20,
     "updated_at":"2018-07-27T16:46:19.847Z",
     "created_at":"2018-07-27T16:46:19.847Z"
}
```
  
### Employees
An individual employee at a business.
- employees work at one business.
- employees have labor entries indicating the time worked.
```json
{
     "id":"f749b9ff-601b-4992-8b51-fc918310ee35",
     "business_id":"b2aeb27b-c85c-4ad8-83d4-d9511063d418",
     "employee_id":"b63d9159-b2f9-4fd0-bb53-5dfeaee89e85",
     "name":"Andy Bolden",
     "closed":true,
     "closed_at":"2018-04-01T17:35:00.000Z",
     "updated_at":"2018-07-31T00:56:16.972Z",
     "created_at":"2018-04-01T17:03:00.000Z"
}
```
    
### Labor Entries
Represents the time and cost for an employee's shift.
- includes `clock_in` and `clock_out` time for a given employee, and the employee's `pay_rate`.
```json
{
    "id": "feb99737-83e5-4989-98ad-e8ad3ad228d7",
    "business_id": "f21c2579-b95e-4a5b-aead-a3cf9d60d43b",
    "employee_id": "b63d9159-b2f9-4fd0-bb53-5dfeaee89e85",
    "name": "Andy Bolden",
    "clock_in": "2018-05-03T15:00:00.000Z",
    "clock_out": "2018-05-03T21:00:00.000Z",
    "pay_rate": 11,
    "updated_at": "2018-07-30T19:23:32.265Z",
    "created_at": "2018-07-30T19:23:32.265Z"
}
```
You can think of an labor entry as a work shift and the given rate of pay at the time the employee worked that shift.

Labor entries are used to calculate labor related reports. 
         
       
## Report Types

These are the techical definitions of the reports that your api will need to implement

### Labor Cost Percentage
 - Abbreviated as **LCP**
 - Labor cost percentage is the percentage of your revenue that pays for labor. 
 - Calculate labor cost percentage: **Labor Cost Percentage = Labor / Sales**
 
     Here’s an example: 
      
     Let’s say you’ve added all money paid out to hourly employees over a week. 
     The total was $5,500. During that same time period, you brought in $22,000 worth of revenue. 
       
     Labor Cost Percentage = $5,500 / $22,000
      
     Labor Cost Percentage = 25%

### Food Cost Percentage 
 - Abbreviated as **FCP**
 - Food cost percentage is the difference between what it costs to produce an item and its price on the menu. 
 - Calculate food cost percentage: **Food Cost Percentage = Item Cost / Selling Prices**
  
      Here’s an example: 
      
      A burger is priced at $13 and costs $4 to make.
     
      Food Cost Percentage = $4 / $13
      
      Food Cost Percentage = 31% 

### Employee Gross Sales
 - Abbreviated as **EGS**
 - Employee gross sales is the sum of the of the price charged for each item the employee sold. Voided Items excluded.
 - Calculate employee gross sales: **Employee Gross Sales = Sum(Selling Prices)**
 
     Here’s an example:
     
     A burger is priced at $13 and a shake $7.
     
     Employee Gross Sales = $13 + $7
     
     Employee Gross Sales = $20
